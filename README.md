# Omadora

Turn a fresh Fedora installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system based on Hyprland by running a single command. This project is a fork of the original [Omadora](https.github.com/basecamp/omadora) project, with the goal of bringing the same streamlined experience to the Fedora Linux distribution.

No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omadora is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best.
